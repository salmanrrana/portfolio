Hello My name is Salman Rana.

I was born in Los Angeles, raised in Texas, and have lived around a few other places
on this beautiful thing we call earth. Moving from place to place has taught me so much about communicating with people, learning on the fly and gaining a
great understanding about the many many differences yet similarities between us all.

After 5 years at Apple, my journey has brought my two passions together: art and technology. I take an approach to building powerful, yet simple, intuitive websites that enrich the user experience. I am excited that you visited my site and I hope that you enjoy my projects!
