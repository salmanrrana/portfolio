Hello My name is Salman Rana.
I was born in Los Angeles, raised in Texas, and have lived around a few other places
on this beautiful thing we call earth. Moving from place to place has taught me a
bunch about communicating with people, learning on the fly and gaining a
great understanding about the many many differences yet similarities between us all.

While I was attending college in Lubbock, Texas, I worked at the student-run radio station.
There I started my journey into radio and my life into music and the arts. I got a morning
radio shift from 7-9 am on a Monday and loved being on Air but was always curios about the position
on the staff and the workings of the back-end of broadcasting and promotions.
I started to shadow the promotions director and attend and then eventually lead the KTXT street team  
on promoting all things KTXT. Soon, the position of Promotions Director opened up and I got the job.
While the previous Promotions Director focused on bringing bigger acts to Lubbock, I saw a
great opportunity to bring small up and coming acts to Lubbock. While this may seem like an inconvenience for most to take this
long trek into West Texas, I saw an opportunity since most touring acts had an open day  between Albuquerque and Dallas/Fort Worth or Austin shows.
Here i started contacting booking agents, bands, creating spots for the radio, contafcting newspapers,
handing out flyers, and anything I could to get people to come out to these events.

After many successful shows, my passion and curiosity for creating the spots grew and an
opening for the production director opened up. While taking on that spot and a new promotions director
on deck, the need for these acts to come through was still there. So while attending school and creating continuous
spots for the radio from psa's, commercials, radio spots, event spots, medical shows, and more, i was booking live
art and music shows in Lubbock.

After graduating from Texas Tech with a Bachelor's degree in creative writing, I moved to New York
City for a change of pace. Here discovered so much more art and music than I could
have ever imagined. It was like a huge playground. While in New York, I got a job at the Apple Store and my
 passion for technology found its way in. At Apple, I learned so much about the products,
 I have to restrain myself from correcting qualms about Apple products
